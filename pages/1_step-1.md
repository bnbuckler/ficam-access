All agencies should use an existing governance structure or establish a new one, if needed, to establish an effective governance structure for access management and collaborating with key stakeholders to help carry the appropriate and consistent access control measures within your agency. It should include key access control stakeholders like, implementers, resource owners, and bureau level managers within the governing body. A diverse governance structure will help with identification of access management concerns and help resolve them, while improving communication and stakeholder buy-in. 


### Checklist

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Establish access control objectives and goals.** During this activity, you should develop enterprise-level access control objectives and goals and strive to achieve access control characteristics. This will result in a streamlined, cost-effective, and efficient access control environment as well as allow access control stakeholders (e.g., access control implementers, managers) across the enterprise to better align with well-defined target state baseline expectations (i.e., minimum requirements) for access control. 

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Coordinate with agency partners and stakeholders.** During this activity, you should work with appropriate stakeholders (e.g., other agencies, data providers) across the Federal Government while implementing access control measures. This will build trust and provide secure and reliable information sharing and interoperability between federal agencies.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Manage stakeholder communication and buy-in.** During this activity, you should develop an outreach and awareness program that incorporates an effective change management approach and communicates enterprise level objectives and goals to all stakeholders (e.g., access control implementers and managers, users) to gain their support and buy-in. This support will result in a smoother transition because stakeholders will understand the benefits and rationale for implementing access control measures across the enterprise.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Consolidate tools and technologies.** During this activity, you should perform an analysis to assess whether access control measures and supporting tools and technologies can be consolidated or whether new ones need to be procured or developed to protect agency resources and meet access control needs. This consolidation will result in cost savings due to the elimination of redundant investments, technologies, and processes and procedures and allow for a more streamlined and efficient access management environment. As processes are consolidated, it may be necessary to move staff members around. A plan should be developed to handle staffing changes.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Facilitate request for funding.** During this activity, you should manage the identification of appropriate funding sources for the program, coordinate and develop the business case for access control needs, and perform a cost/benefit analysis for required access control measures. Successful completion of these activities helps to develop a strong justification for the implementation funds being requested. 

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Oversee ongoing resource risk assessments.** During this activity, you should manage the process of performing and analyzing resource risk assessments. The management of resource risk assessments determines security and access control requirements to protect agency resources across the enterprise. It also can help determine if all resources are evaluated per the standards set by authoritative sources (e.g., Office of Management and Budget [OMB], Interagency Security Committee [ISC], NIST).
