All agencies should establish an effective governance structure for access management and collaborating with key stakeholders. Your governance structure should include key access control stakeholders like, implementers, resource owners, and bureau level managers within the governing body. A diverse governance structure will help you identify and resolve access management concerns while improving communication and stakeholder buy-in. 


### Checklist

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Establish access control goals and objectives.** You should develop enterprise-level access control goals and objectives and strive to achieve access control characteristics. You will also allow access control stakeholders (e.g., access control implementers, managers) across the enterprise to better align with your defined target state (i.e., minimum requirements) for access control. 

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Coordinate with agency partners and stakeholders.** You should work with appropriate stakeholders (e.g., other agencies, data providers) across the Federal Government as you implement your access control measures. This will help you build trust with your stakeholders and provide secure and reliable information sharing and interoperability between federal agencies.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Manage stakeholder communication and buy-in.** You should develop an outreach and awareness program that incorporates an effective change management approach and communicates enterprise level goals and objectives to all stakeholders. You will needstakeholders to understand the benefits and rationale for implementing access control measures across the enterprise.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Consolidate tools and technologies.** You should assess whether access control tools and technologies can be consolidated or whether new ones need to be procured or developed to meet your access control needs. Consolicating tools and technologies will allow for a more streamlined and efficient access management environment and may save you some money and resources. As you consolidate processes, you may find that you need to move staff members around. Depending on how significant the changes are, you may want to consider updates to your Staffing Plan.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Facilitate request for funding.** You will need to identify funding for the program, develop a business case, and perform a cost/benefit analysis for required access control measures. Successful completion of these activities will go a long way in helping you secure the funding requested for your access control implementation.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Oversee ongoing resource risk assessments.** You should manage the process of performing and analyzing resource risk assessments. Managing resource risk assessments helps you determine security and access control requirements that you'll need to protect agency resources across the enterprise. It will also help you determine if all your resources are evaluated against the standards set by authoritative sources (e.g., Office of Management and Budget [OMB], Interagency Security Committee [ISC], NIST).
