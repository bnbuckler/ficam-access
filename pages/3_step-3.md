After conducting a policy analysis, you should define your agencies access control requirements. This process will help you determine the access control model(s) and supporting enablers that best fit your agency’s needs. 


### Checklist 

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Conduct inventory of agency resources.** During this activity, you should create an inventory of all physical and logical resources in your agency. This will provide an overview of all agency resources that need to be accounted for, managed, and protected across the enterprise. 

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Analyze resource capabilities.** Perform an analysis on your agency’s resource capabilities. Most resources that need to be protected are designed to support a set number of services, which can have an impact on the type of access control model(s) and supporting enablers used during policy execution. Analyzing resource capabilities will help implementers identify which access control model(s) and supporting enablers should be considered as viable options for protecting the resource. For example, a protected resource that only has the capability to process access control lists will not be able to support a sophisticated access control model such as Policy-Based Access Control (PBAC). In addition, this analysis will help federal agencies determine if additional tools or technologies need to be developed or procured to complement or replace their current resources. 

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Analyze your user population.** You should perform a thorough analysis of your user population for each resource. Information about known users is typically managed internally, which provides agencies the flexibility to use any of the access control models, while allowing other determinations/factors (e.g., risk, resource capabilities, enablers, and tools and technologies requirements) to determine the access control measure(s). The requirements developed from analyzing your agency’s user population and the resource risk assessment can serve as the core factors you should consider when selecting and implementing access control measures and supporting enablers across the enterprise.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Analyze data elements.** Many data elements are retrieved during policy execution to determine if a user should be allowed access to a protected resource. You should perform an analysis of the data used during policy execution to determine data type and quality, stored location and availability, and retrieval method, including appropriate protection of the data during transit based on sensitivity levels. The results from this analysis will create requirements that will help your agency better identify and manage appropriate data elements and determine which tools and technologies are required to process the data elements used to provision access to a subject during policy execution. 

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Analyze existing tools and technologies.** Lastly, you should perform an analysis on your current tools and technologies that can be used to address the requirements produced during the Policy Analysis, Resource Analysis and Data Analysis processes. Analyzing tools and technologies that are already implemented will allow you create requirements that can help determine if your current assets address the security, access control, and data requirements, identified during requirements planning or if new tools and technologies need to be procured or developed. This can also lead to potential cost savings as it allows your agency to use the current infrastructure before procuring or developing new tools and technologies. If new tools and technologies are needed, you should also calculate return on investment (ROI) to evaluate whether the new tools and technologies should be procured or developed. 

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Define Agency-level Privacy Requirements.** Assess whether existing privacy and data protection requirements/guidelines are sufficient to address privacy concerns associated with Logical Access Control System (LACS) automation and data sharing or if additional privacy requirements are needed for specific LACS services.
