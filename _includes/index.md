# <span style="color: #0C5C89"><a name="plan"></a>Plan for Access Control</span>

Access control refers to the common processes and technologies that allow both physical and logical access control. Controlling access to agency resources is critical to maintaining security of all assets across an enterprise. Your agency should work to achieve a centralized access management environment by implementing tools and technologies at the enterprise level and streamline and automate applicable access control processes and procedures, where possible. To implement appropriate access control measures and supporting enablers, such as data, policies, tools and technologies, your agency must strive to strengthen security, improve efficiencies, reduce costs, and drive towards automation. The following steps provide guidance on how to establish governments and understand your requirements for access management. 


## <span style="color: #a61406"><a name="step1"></a>**Step 1: Establish an Access Governance Structure**</span>

All agencies should use an existing governance structure or establish a new one, if needed, to establish an effective governance structure for access management and collaborating with key stakeholders to help carry the appropriate and consistent access control measures within your agency. It should include key access control stakeholders like, implementers, resource owners, and bureau level managers within the governing body. A diverse governance structure will help with identification of access management concerns and help resolve them, while improving communication and stakeholder buy-in. 


### Checklist

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Establish access control objectives and goals.** During this activity, you should develop enterprise-level access control objectives and goals and strive to achieve access control characteristics. This will result in a streamlined, cost-effective, and efficient access control environment as well as allow access control stakeholders (e.g., access control implementers, managers) across the enterprise to better align with well-defined target state baseline expectations (i.e., minimum requirements) for access control. 

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Coordinate with agency partners and stakeholders.** During this activity, you should work with appropriate stakeholders (e.g., other agencies, data providers) across the Federal Government while implementing access control measures. This will build trust and provide secure and reliable information sharing and interoperability between federal agencies.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Manage stakeholder communication and buy-in.** During this activity, you should develop an outreach and awareness program that incorporates an effective change management approach and communicates enterprise level objectives and goals to all stakeholders (e.g., access control implementers and managers, users) to gain their support and buy-in. This support will result in a smoother transition because stakeholders will understand the benefits and rationale for implementing access control measures across the enterprise.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Consolidate tools and technologies.** During this activity, you should perform an analysis to assess whether access control measures and supporting tools and technologies can be consolidated or whether new ones need to be procured or developed to protect agency resources and meet access control needs. This consolidation will result in cost savings due to the elimination of redundant investments, technologies, and processes and procedures and allow for a more streamlined and efficient access management environment.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Facilitate request for funding.** During this activity, you should manage the identification of appropriate funding sources for the program, coordinate and develop the business case for access control needs, and perform a cost/benefit analysis for required access control measures. Successful completion of these activities helps to develop a strong justification for the implementation funds being requested. 

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Oversee ongoing resource risk assessments.** During this activity, you should manage the process of performing and analyzing resource risk assessments. The management of resource risk assessments determines security and access control requirements to protect agency resources across the enterprise. It also can help determine if all resources are evaluated per the standards set by authoritative sources (e.g., Office of Management and Budget [OMB], Interagency Security Committee [ISC], NIST). 


## <span style="color: #a61406"><a name="step2"></a>**Step 2: Conduct a Policy Analysis**</span>

To properly collect your agency’s requirements, you must fully understand your agency’s current policies across the enterprise. Benefits of conducting a policy analysis include gaining a better understanding of baseline access control expectations and limitations, the selection and implementation of access control measures, and supporting enablers to protect your agency’s resources.


### Checklist 

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Analyze existing policies.** You should review your agencies current policies and identify the policies that may have an impact on access management decisions. You should determine if your agency’s current access control policies are align with the broader access control objectives and goals. This will allow you to determine if your agency should develop new policies to enforce appropriate access control requirements agency-wide.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Establish baseline access control policies.** During this activity, you should define baseline access control policies that define minimum security requirements for access control at the enterprise level. This will help establish access control standards for protecting agency resources across the enterprise.


## <span style="color: #a61406"><a name="step3"></a>**Step 3: Define Your Agency's Access Control Requirements**</span>

After conducting a policy analysis, you should define your agencies access control requirements. This process will help you determine the access control model(s) and supporting enablers that best fit your agency’s needs. 


### Checklist 

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Conduct inventory of agency resources.** During this activity, you should create an inventory of all physical and logical resources in your agency. This will provide an overview of all agency resources that need to be accounted for, managed, and protected across the enterprise. 

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Analyze resource capabilities.** Perform an analysis on your agency’s resource capabilities. Most resources that need to be protected are designed to support a set number of services, which can have an impact on the type of access control model(s) and supporting enablers used during policy execution. Analyzing resource capabilities will help implementers identify which access control model(s) and supporting enablers should be considered as viable options for protecting the resource. For example, a protected resource that only has the capability to process access control lists will not be able to support a sophisticated access control model such as PBAC. In addition, this analysis will help federal agencies determine if additional tools or technologies need to be developed or procured to complement or replace their current resources. 

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Analyze your user population.** You should perform a thorough analysis of your user population for each resource. Information about known users is typically managed internally, which provides agencies the flexibility to use any of the access control models, while allowing other determinations/factors (e.g., risk, resource capabilities, enablers, and tools and technologies requirements) to determine the access control measure(s). The requirements developed from analyzing your agency’s user population and the resource risk assessment can serve as the core factors you should consider when selecting and implementing access control measures and supporting enablers across the enterprise.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Analyze data elements.** Many data elements are retrieved during policy execution to determine if a user should be allowed access to a protected resource. You should perform an analysis of the data used during policy execution to determine data type and quality, stored location and availability, and retrieval method, including appropriate protection of the data during transit based on sensitivity levels. The results from this analysis will create requirements that will help your agency better identify and manage appropriate data elements and determine which tools and technologies are required to process the data elements used to provision access to a subject during policy execution. 

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Analyze existing tools and technologies.** Lastly, you should perform an analysis on your current tools and technologies that can be used to address the requirements produced during the Policy Analysis, Resource Analysis and Data Analysis processes. Analyzing tools and technologies that are already implemented will allow you create requirements that can help determine if your current assets address the security, access control, and data requirements, identified during requirements planning or if new tools and technologies need to be procured or developed. This can also lead to potential cost savings as it allows your agency to use the current infrastructure before procuring or developing new tools and technologies. If new tools and technologies are needed, you should also calculate return on investment (ROI) to evaluate whether the new tools and technologies should be procured or developed. 


## <span style="color: #a61406"><a name="step4"></a>**Step 4: Identify and Assess Your Protected Resources**</span>

Your agency has valuable assets that require levels of protection. Identification may require gathering information from multiple existing resource inventories because the processes used to identify, track, and catalog resources are often distributed across multiple programs and systems within your agency. Each program or system typically collects and manages information about a subset of the agency’s resources to support a specific business function. For example, all agencies are required under FISMA to have a complete, current inventory of IT systems. ICAM implementers must be able to retrieve information about these resources quickly and efficiently to effectively manage access to them in a coordinated fashion. Additionally, physical and logical resources typically are managed separately from each other within an agency.

For many existing resources, your agency has likely already determined which resources require protection and the necessary level of protection. Guidance for determining protection requirements for information systems, devices, and infrastructure is outlined in many existing policy and guidance documents (e.g., M-04-04, FIPS 199, M-06-16). Guidance for determining levels of protection for facilities and work sites which require electronic security systems is provided by the Interagency Security Committee (ISC). It can be expected that an agency’s physical security group will have previously evaluated all existing facilities and sites within the agency’s custody and determined physical protection requirements; however, for geographically dispersed organizations, this information may be managed locally. The figure below discusses several common programs and functions that collect and manage this information, and may therefore provide a starting point for ICAM implementers.

<br>

| <center> Agency Function </center> | <center> Information Available </center> | <center> Resource Type </center> |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Facility Management Group / Physical Security Group | Information regarding resources that must be secured using Physical Access Control System (PACS). | <center> Physical </center> | 
| Real Property Group | Information regarding land, building, and improvements that are owned or leased by a federal agency. | <center> Physical </center> | 
| Capital Planning and Investment Control (CPIC) Program | Investment information for capital assets submitted by a federal agency to OMB for funding. | <center> Physical </center><center> Logical </center> |

### Checklist 

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Identify Content and Information.** Content is data structured in a usable form to serve specific purposes. Information is any communication or representation of knowledge such as facts, data, or opinions in any medium or form, including textual, numerical, graphic, cartographic, narrative, or audiovisual. Content and information are stored in federal systems and used in the business functions of a federal agency, and can include digital information stored within a database or application. The protection of content and information is important to achieve and maintain confidentiality, integrity, and availability. 

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Identify Applications and Web Services.** An application is a software program hosted by an information system that performs specific functions. A web service is a software system designed to support interactive and automated interaction with information systems over a network. Together, applications and web services represent the intangible assets that provide functional capabilities that allow federal employees to perform the business functions of their agencies. Examples of applications and web services include employee timekeeping, reporting, and other agency-specific software hosted on local workstations, agency servers, and web-based services, such as a cloud environment. Protecting applications and web services prevents unauthorized users from accessing federal IT systems that host sensitive information, which could affect the availability and reliability of those systems. 

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Identify Networks and Infrastructure.** A network is an information system implemented with a collection of interconnected components. Infrastructure is the hardware, storage, servers, and data center space or network components that provide IT services to an organization. Networks and infrastructure together represent any tangible technological assets that are interconnected to support the IT needs of an agency, which can include computer networks, servers, switches, hubs, mainframes, and the physical technology that support them. The protection of networks and infrastructure is crucial because they support the agency’s enterprise IT environment. If one element is compromised, related protected resources may become vulnerable.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Identify Facilities.** Facilities are all buildings and/or portions of buildings occupied by federal employees (includes existing owned, to be purchased or leased facilities, stand-alone facilities, federal campuses, individual facilities on federal campuses, and special-use facilities). Safeguards for the protection of federal locations not only prevent physical attacks on the location overall, but also the resources housed within the location.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Perform a risk assessments for both physical (e.g., facilities) and logical (e.g., network and infrastructure) resources.** To complete this assessment, you must follow federal guidelines outlined in the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/ISC_Risk-Management-Process_Aug_2013.pdf" target="_blank"> Risk Management Process for Federal Facilities: An Interagency Security Committee Standard</a> and the <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-37-rev1/sp800-37-rev1-final.pdf" target="_blank"> Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems.</a> The Resource Risk Assessment will also help you create access control requirements based on the level of risk identified for each physical or logical resource.  


### Benefits

> <i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></i> &nbsp;**Each resource has its own role in your agency’s mission and is subject to potential vulnerabilities and threats.** You must consider how to minimize those vulnerabilities and mitigate threats while maximizing the effective use of the resource and making it available to the appropriate users. As you perform risk assessments of the resources, you’ll be able to identify resource vulnerabilities and the associated risks, and devise solutions to mitigate the risks. The results of this process will determine what other specific elements of the Access Management Framework should be applied during the implementation. This assessment should consist of evaluating how alternative access control models might be applied to the resource, including centrally-controlled enterprise systems and the capabilities of the local resource.

</div>

## <span style="color: #a61406"><a name="step5"></a>**Step 5: Collect and Organize Resource Information**</span>

You must collect, analyze, and understand your agencies resources to determine the necessary level of protection to establish effective access control policies.  Background information about a resource is often required to support access control decisions. This information can often be obtained by reviewing resource documentation and meeting with resource owners/administrators to discuss how and why access is currently controlled. Examples of contextual information that can be used to support access control are provided in the figure below.

<br>

| <center> Information Componenent </center> | <center> Description </center> |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Time-based access restriction** | Access to the resource is restricted during particular hours or certain times of the day, week, or year based upon resource requirements |
| **Certification-based access restriction** | Access to the resource requires possession of a particular certification or permit |
| **Organizational affiliation restriction** | Resource access requires a particular affiliation with the organization (e.g., IT systems for federal employee access only), or affiliation with a particular bureau/component/office, etc. |
| **Location-based restriction** | Access to the resource is restricted based on geographical location for both physical and logical resources, and/or Internet Protocol (IP) and Media Access Control (MAC) address for IT resources and data |
| **Resource-based restriction** | Access to certain data or information is dependent upon it being accessed through a particular resource, thereby preventing direct access. | 
| **Data sensitivity restriction** | Certain IT resources or data elements may require that users possess a level of public trust or clearance (National Agency Check with Written Inquiries [NACI], Public Trust, Secret, etc.) before being accessed. | 

### Checklist

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Organize your agency’s resources.** You can organize your agency’s resources by using common criteria as a means of providing baseline privileges in an automated fashion. You can do this by examining the resource attributes that determine how users are granted access and looking for similarities that drive access control decisions. Resources may be grouped in several ways, including:

>> * **Physical Location.** Many agencies with multiple offices/buildings in metropolitan areas often grant access to all facilities within that area as a means of ensuring that personnel can easily attend meetings in nearby offices, this may also extend to network/system access associated with a geographic location.

>> * **Project/Program Affiliation.** Projects or programs that rely on a small subset of information systems or specified work locations can group those resources and grant access based upon affiliation with the project or program rather than granting each person access to each individual resource.

>> * **Organizational Relationship.** Within an agency there may be components or bureaus that grant access to resources based upon organizational affiliation (i.e., a component/bureau specific information sharing tool).

>> * **Function/Purpose.** Similar to Project/Program affiliation, certain resources may support a common function or purpose within an organization (i.e., HR systems, accounting systems, etc.).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# <span style="color: #0C5C89"><a name="framework"></a>What is the Access Management Framework?</span>

The Access Management Framework was developed to provide you with the guidance to implement access control in your enterprise environment. It shows the many areas and components used to establish access management policies.

The picture below is a view of the Access Management Framework and its key components.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/framework.png"/></div>

<br>

You should consider each part of this Framework while implementing access control measures. The diagram shows how each component is related and builds upon each other to protect and ensure the appropriate sharing of resources. It describes the design-time elements that are addressed during the planning stages and the run-time actions that occur in real-time during an attempt to access a resource. Policy Execution is the run-time process that results in a determination as to whether access to a protected resource is granted or denied based on the enablers that have been developed in the design-time phase. Policy execution is the culmination of each component of the Framework coming together to achieve the targeted level of protection for a resource. 

Policy execution is initiated when a user attempts to access a protected resource. The various tools and technologies then retrieve elements that are required by the access control model and evaluate the data inputs and the requirements of the policy to render an access control decision that is compliant with the appropriate policy. Each access control model involves different enablers in the decision making process as outlined in the figure below. The access models below will be discussed in more detail in Step 6.

| <center> Access Control Model </center> | <center> Enablers Retrieved/Referenced </center> | <center> Access Granted If: </center>| 
|:----------------------------------------|----------------|---------------------|

<br>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# <span style="color: #0C5C89"><a name="administer"></a>Administer the Access Management Framework</span>

The Administration part of the Framework is the first element within what is commonly referred to as the “design-time” phase of access control implementation. It serves to address the development of components that access control requires. This development is completed through four lifecycles that ultimately produce the enablers used in the access control decision making process. 

## <span style="color: #a61406"><a name="step6"></a>**Step 6: Choose your Access Control Model**</span>

To successfully manage access to resources, you must ensure that certain elements of information about the user and the resource are paired within the proper context to make an access decision. Your agency can use many access control models to determine how to handle user and resource attributes within access control transactions. Access control models are conceptual ways to express how an access control system implements specific policies using its underlying infrastructure components and security mechanisms. 

We’ve listed the five access control models below. When considering each option, it’s important for you to evaluate their access control needs, the capabilities of each resource being protected, and the overall risk to that resource. Your agency must implement some form of access control for each protected resource it owns. 

### Static Models

| <center> Model </center> | <center> Description </center> |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Access Control List (ACL)** |  Based on a list of permissions associated with an object. The list specifies who or what is allowed to access the object and what operations are allowed to be performed on the object. An ACL is a popular access control model used within the Federal Government. ACLs provide a simple way for resource owners to grant specific access permissions based on defined privileges associated with each user within a resource. The management of ACLs is typically performed by an agent of the protected resource owner and normally requires manual intervention. When a new user requires access to the protected resource, a request is submitted to the resource owner. If the user is authorized, the resource owner, or its agent, provisions the user’s account with the appropriate permissions (e.g., edit a file or unlock a door). User permissions are typically tracked via a decentralized system often developed by the resource owner, such as a spreadsheet, database, or even a list of users in a notebook associated with their access rights. |
| **Role-based Access Control (RBAC)** |Used for controlling access to resources where permitted actions on resources are identified with roles rather than with individual subject identities. Using roles can simplify the administration of user permissions; they can be functional, organizational, or even customized to suit the needs of a particular agency. Each role is associated with a specific set of permissions to a set of protected resources and each user is assigned to and provisioned into one or more roles. In an RBAC system, when a new user needs to be provisioned access to a resource, their account is added to the role for which they’ll be granted access. For example, when a new manager joins an organization, their account is added to the Manager role within the RBAC system, providing access to all resources granted to managers within the organization. In comparison, an ACL system would require the user’s account and their permission to be manually added separately. |

### Dynamic Models

| <center> Model </center> | <center> Description </center> |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC)** | Introduces specific characteristics or “attributes” (e.g., demographic data, employment affiliation, and citizen status) associated with and about subjects, objects, targets, initiators, resources, or the environment. An access control rule set defines the combination of attributes under which an access may take place. The ability to retrieve attributes associated with a user provides resource owners with the flexibility of facilitating access to external users as long as attributes associated with the user are available and meet the defined requirements for access. Policies define attribute requirements for given resources. ABAC grants or denies access based on attributes that are submitted or retrieved in response to an access request. Examples of attributes are demographic data, employment affiliation, citizenship status, data attributes (tags), environmental attributes, etc. These attributes can be submitted directly by a subject or collected from various internal and external attribute sources (such as an employer’s database). The values associated with the attributes submitted are then compared with the attribute values required by the access control policy. If the values submitted or retrieved meet the requirements of the access control policy, access is granted. |
| **Policy-based Access Control (PBAC)** | Uses authorization policy that is flexible in the types of evaluated parameters (e.g., identity, role, clearance, operational need, risk, heuristics). It expands on the variety of attributes employed in the access control decision process and addresses the need for organizations to adhere to abstract policy requirements and regulations (e.g., Sarbanes-Oxley Act [SOX] and Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act), when implementing access control measures. PBAC uses enterprise-wide attributes from the protected resource, the environment, the action performed, and the requester to make an access control decision based on the applicable access control policies, the attributes provided, and the given access request circumstances. Once an access attempt is made, the access control decision is determined by assessing each of the submitted attributes, the given circumstances, and the appropriate policy that applies to those circumstances. The required enablers for policy execution are retrieved and an access control decision is made based on whether the data match the requirements defined in the policy. |
| **Risk-Adaptable Access Control (RAdAC)** | Uses an authorization policy that takes into account operational need, risk, and heuristics. The RAdAC model further expands on the variety of attributes considered during an access control decision and enhances security by introducing a threat level element into the access control equation. Organizations can calculate a quantifiable risk metric based on factors such as a user’s trustworthiness, information about the corporate IT infrastructure, and other environmental risk factors. This calculated risk metric can then be used to dictate what types and amount of user-related information is required during an access attempt. This information may vary so that the level of security is commensurate with the threat level. When accessing a resource protected by RAdAC, a user’s access attempt will require certain information elements that are determined by the risk metric. Once information is transmitted, it’s assessed against the access control policies related to the current threat level. These policies could include a wide variety of factors such as determining the operational needs of a user based on the current threat level. Additionally, the requirements for access control decisions should be made based on a diverse set of situations and risk levels. RAdAC also allows for a certain level of machine learning (heuristics) that involves considering past access control decisions as a factor when making future access control decisions. This heuristic information can then be used to improve access control policies by targeting risk and operational need determinations. Considering the vast amount of data being referenced and the technology involved during the Policy Execution part, RAdAC is the most complex access control model for agencies to implement. |

<strong><span>Limitations</span></strong>
<p><span>• Ability to evaluate individual access privileges becomes extremely complex as the list grows larger over time.<br>• Criteria for access and individual role/job duties are fluid over time, thereby placing a significant administrator burden on resources owners.<br>• Nearly impossible to manage at an enterprise level due to the sheer volume of resources and ACLs.<br>• Requires manual changes to ACL, a time consuming and error prone process.<br>• Revocation of access privileges may be delayed due to non-automated communication methods (e.g., word of mouth, e-mail, paper form distribution, etc.).</span></p>

<strong><span>Key Takeaways</span></strong>
<p><span>ACLs are useful and often sufficient when granting access to resources to a relatively small number of internal users that can be easily managed and monitored by a resource owner.</span></p>

<h3><span>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</span></h3>
<p><span>Individuals are assigned to various roles within an organization, down to the resource level based upon certain identity and entitlement attributes. Access is determined by having a particular role assignment that corresponds to one or more resources.</span></p>

<strong><span>Benefits</span></strong>
<p><span>• Supports groupings of individuals with particular roles based upon well-defined and trusted attributes.<br>• Can accommodate centralized management.<br>• Can be implemented at various levels within an organization, as long as a valid role is defined.<br>• Supported by common operating systems and capable of group support as well.</span></p>

<strong><span>Limitations</span></strong>
<p><span>• Can be difficult to manage as each protected resource generally has unique role requirements, thereby resulting in large numbers of potential role assignments within an organization.<br>• Difficult to manage granular access of individuals due to the rigid nature of role assignments.<br>• Difficult to implement in a highly distributed agency (not centrally managed).<br>• Requires significant level of effort to determine appropriate alignment of privileges for users not linked to the agency’s organizational structure.</span></p>

<strong><span>Key Takeaways</span></strong>
<p><span> RBAC can be useful in agencies that have established and well-defined roles for their users. Additionally, this model is effective when external users either do not require access to protected resources or when the host agency can easily control the roles assigned to external users.</span></p>

<div style="background-color: #edf1f3;color: black;margin: 10px;padding: 10px">

<h3><span>Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)</span></h3>
<p><span>Focuses on characteristics that describe people, resources and environments. The requester provides attributes which are compared to those documented as requirements for granting or denying access, at which point a decision is made.</span></p>

<strong><span>Benefits</span></strong>
<p><span>• Requires no advance knowledge of requestors.<br>• An individual’s attributes can be correlated from multiple sources to create a unified identity.<br>• Highly adaptable to changing needs; efficient for agencies where individuals come and go frequently.</span></p>

<strong><span>Limitations</span></strong>
<p><span>• Lengthy implementation time due to the need to correlate information and attributes from multiple sources for all potential users.<br>• Reliant on authoritative identity/entitlement data – difficulty managing attribute conflicts between source systems.<br>• Not natively supported by common operating systems.<br>• Not appropriate for all environments (i.e., those with significant changes in risk level).</span></p>

<strong><span>Key Takeaways</span></strong>
<p><span> ABAC requires the ability to request and retrieve a variety of attributes and attribute sources for it to be an effective model in making access control decisions. <br><br>Since ABAC is not natively supported by most systems, the availability of tools and technologies is extremely important. </span></p>

<h3><span>Policy-Based Access Control (PBAC))</span></h3>
<p><span>Access to resources is granted on a resource-by-resource basis, based upon an individual’s inclusion and corresponding privileges, as noted on the resource’s ACL.</span></p>

<strong><span>Benefits</span></strong>
<p><span>• Promotes compliance with standardized access controls.<br>• Flexible in not being linked to only one type of access control.<br>• Adapts quickly to new policy rules.</span></p> 

<strong><span>Limitations</span></strong>
<p><span>• PBAC requires the design, deployment, and seamless integration of enterprise level systems (databases, directory services, etc.).<br>• Policies must be absolutely unambiguous to avoid unintentional, unauthorized access.<br>• Entire enterprise must use the same attributes for access and those attributes must be authoritative.• Not natively supported by common operating systems.</span></p>

<strong><span>Key Takeaways</span></strong>
<p><span>PBAC can benefit agencies that have resources which require varying levels of security and the budget to invest in the development of the standard elements required by the solution. </span></p>

<h3><span>Risk-Adaptable Access Control (RAdAC)</span></h3>
<p><span>Amount of information required of requesters to verify their identity depends on the current threat level, information includes personal trustworthiness and environmental factors.</span></p>

<strong><span>Benefits</span></strong>
<p><span>• Has the ability to make real time access control available.<br>• Can control multiple diverse systems- including digital policies as some systems may require different authentication levels for the same user based transactions.<br>• Supports flexible situations. </span></p>

<strong><span>Limitations</span></strong>
<p><span>• Cannot always be automatic, user judgments are needed.<br>• Integrated systems must use standardized data exchange formats.<br>• Policies must be unambiguous to avoid unintentional, unauthorized access.<br>• Extensive considerations in adhering to policy and law – involves great care to be taken to ensure compliance.<br>• Not natively supported by common operating systems.</span></p>

<strong><span>Key Takeaways</span></strong>
<p><span>Agencies that likely will benefit from implementing a RAdAC system are those that:<br><br>• Need the flexibility to adapt their access control based on environmental conditions, such as risk and/or the need for situational awareness;<br>• Have well defined internal policies and/or may be required to comply with additional federal and regulatory policies; and<br>• Have tightly controlled enterprise environments consisting of well integrated systems that operate using standardized data exchange formats. </span></p>

## <span style="color: #a61406"><a name="step7"></a>**Step 7: Implement the Data Management Life Cycle**</span>

The Data Management Life Cycle focuses on identifying, obtaining, and maintaining required data elements that enable access control decisions. Maintaining current data is essential to effective access management. Using incorrect or out of date data can lead to successful access attempts by unauthorized users that put an agency’s resources in jeopardy. The Data Management Life Cycle defines the phases agencies can follow to maintain current data.

### Checklist 

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Identify requirements and obtain data required by your access control model.** This data includes attributes and their associated metadata about subjects, resources, and the contextual environment. Once you’ve have identified what data is required, you’ll need to determine where it’s located, how to obtain authorization to regularly retrieve it, and establish the authoritative source for required attributes. Required data could be within your resource’s systems (and therefore accessible) or it may be located elsewhere within your agency, or at an external source. Acquiring data that’s not currently available to a resource requires coordinating with the owner of that data and coming to an agreement on its use, definition, and how it will be obtained or transferred. 

<div style="background-color: #edf1f3;color: black;margin: 10px;padding: 10px">

<h3><span>What is data and what types of data exist?</span></h3>
<p><span>NIST defines data as “a subset of information in an electronic format that allows it to be retrieved or transmitted.” The data components in the Framework serve to enable access control decisions by providing the information necessary to make those decisions. This information can include details about subjects, protected resources and other information that is considered when granting access to a resource.
There are three main types of data:</span></p>

<strong><span>Subject/Identity Data</span></strong><p><span>Information about a subject and the available details about their identity. A subject is an individual, process, or device causing information to flow among objects or changes to the system state. Subject/identity data is a product of the Data Management Life Cycle and is used to uniquely identify a subject, which allows an access control model to map the subject to their appropriate access permissions. The Policy Execution part of the Framework then uses this information to grant access accordingly. Subject/identity data includes attributes and their associated metadata about a specific subject.</span></p>

<strong><span>Protected Resource Data</span></strong><p><span>The details about a protected resource relevant to making an access control decision. Protected resource data is a product of the Data Management Life Cycle and is used to identify characteristics of a protected resource. This information can include elements such as the security clearance level required for access to a resource or specified emergency situations during which access can be restricted even further with increased requirements.</span></p>

<strong><span>Environmental/Contextual Data</span></strong><p><span>Data about situational elements that can affect access control decisions. Environmental/contextual data is the product of the Data Management Life Cycle and allows for more flexibility in access control decisions and policy. Environmental data can include information such as the time of day or current security threat level. This data provides the Policy Execution part of the Framework with more data elements to consider when making a decision. For instance, access to a resource may need to be limited to a smaller number of subjects if the security threat level is raised. If that information is available, it can be incorporated into the decision to automatically restrict access to only those authorized during a period when the security threat level is elevated.</span></p>

</div>

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Process and integrate data.** Once data is obtained, you must integrate and possibly format the data so that it can be used to make an access control decision. This processing can include entering data, verifying its authenticity, extracting data into a usable form, or simply importing it from the data source. Processing formats data so that it can be appropriately consumed during an access control decision.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Analyze data.** During this phase, you’ll analyze data to capitalize on any opportunities that may require further interpretation of data. This can involve tagging data to make it more useful to a wider array of resources, performing quality assurance practices, or even detecting patterns that can be used in the development of policies that advance access security.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Preserve data.** Data preservation involves the processes and procedures performed to store data for future reuse. During this phase, you’ll store timeframes and establish intervals. Preservation may include the archival of certain data elements for historical purposes. The preservation of data minimizes the amount of duplicative work performed because it eliminates the need to acquire data that’s already stored and/or archived. It also provides additional opportunities to share the stored data with business partners to exercise in their own access control processes, including the real-time retrieval of subject/identity data from authoritative sources.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Use data to make decisions.** Data is used during the Policy Execution part of the Framework to determine if the subject is authorized to access the protected resource. The access control model components in the Framework diagram reference the data necessary to render an access control decision in the Policy Execution part.


## <span style="color: #a61406"><a name="step8"></a>**Step 8: Implement the Privilege Management Life Cycle**</span>

Privilege management is the process of defining and managing the permissions associated with a subject. The authorization decision relies on the presence or absence of one or more access permissions. Similar to the Data Management Life Cycle, the Privilege Management Life Cycle supports the periodic refresh of this data so that access decisions are not based on expired, incorrect information.

As you work towards automated access control for protected resources, you should incorporate the ability to dynamically determine privileges, which will allow for a more flexible and adaptive access control solution that enables the automatic provisioning of unanticipated users.

### Checklist

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Define Access Permissions.** Examine source systems to determine available permission attributes and selecting those that are necessary to determine access permissions.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Provision Access.** Create user access accounts and assigning access privileges associated with selected agency resources.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Review Periodically.*** Implement mandatory control mechanisms to revalidate access levels and modifying permissions at regular intervals related to the risk of the protected resource. Access privileges may require adjustment based on promotions, job changes, role changes, situational variations, etc.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**De-provision Access.** Removing user access permissions to resources when access is no longer required to complete job duties or when the individual leaves the organization.

<div style="background-color: #edf1f3;color: black;margin: 10px;padding: 10px">

<h5><span>*Review Periodically: Auditing and Reporting</span></h5>
<p><span> The FICAM Architecture does not specify particular requirements for auditing and reporting capabilities; however, many of the efforts agencies will be performing on their physical and logical access control systems present an opportunity to improve and automate their existing capabilities. For PACS, the transition to enterprise level services increases the visibility into logged access event data and increases the ability to correlate that data across individual site PACS, resulting in improved auditing and reporting capabilities. For logical access, many of the commercially available solutions that can be used to provide enterprise LACS services include native auditing and reporting tools that can be configured to meet a variety of agency requirements.</span></p> 

</div>

## <span style="color: #a61406"><a name="step9"></a>**Step 9: Implement the Policy Administration Life Cycle**</span>

You should create well-defined, meaningful policies that address the security needs of your agency for effective access control. The Policy Administration Life Cycle produces policies that meet the requirements of the resource and access control model which are converted into digital policies in the Enablers part of the Framework. When using the more advanced access control models, these policies can support an agency’s efforts for establishing a centralized, enterprise-wide access control solution.

### Checklist

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Define the access control policy scope and requirements for a target asset or resource.** The following considerations and inputs influence the access control policy definition process, including but not limited to: environment, users, unauthorized access risks, and existing policies, rules or internal processes that currently govern access to the resource or asset. The purpose of the Policy Definition process is to hone the general access control requirements of the protected resource into specific, well-defined requirements while taking other factors into account, such as federal standards and agency policies.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Analyze policy definitions.** During this process, you’ll examine and analyze the policy definition outputs and findings that will help refine or create new access control policies. The analysis of the risks, rules, and inputs discovered is used to determine the authentication token type, the access control model, the relevant authorization model, and the tools used to enforce access. As previously mentioned, the access control model has an effect on every aspect of the Framework and should be selected appropriately. 

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Create access control policies using access control mechanisms and technology platforms.** During this creation phase, you’ll focus on building access control policies based on the rules, requirements, and designs developed in previous phases. You’ll also need to test use cases to evaluate the efficacy of the policy created are developed during this phase.

<div style="background-color: #edf1f3;color: black;margin: 10px;padding: 10px">

<h3><span>How are digital policies created?</span></h3>
<p><span>Each access control model has different requirements for the Digital Policy. As a result, the type of access control model being used ultimately determines the format of the digital policy. The differences between the access control models and how digital policies are created are outlined below:</span></p>

<strong><span>ACL</span></strong><p><span>The creation of a digital policy for an ACL involves building the ACL based on the Access Permissions that define which subjects are approved for access to a resource and at what access levels. This is usually done by referencing a list of users that have been approved to access the resource, adding their account to the ACL within the resource, and associating the proper permissions with their account. The ACL is referenced when a subject makes an access attempt and access is granted accordingly.</span></p>

<strong><span>RBAC</span></strong><p><span>An RBAC Digital Policy requires the creation of well-defined roles that can be used to distinguish different sets of subjects based on their relationship to the agency or resource. These pre-defined roles carry a specific set of privileges associated with them. Once roles are defined, subjects can be assigned as many roles as needed based on their Access Permissions in order gain access to resources required to perform their work. Depending on the implementation, these roles can be stored in centralized systems for an enterprise solution or can be managed locally for a smaller set of resources. These roles and rights are used to make access control decisions.</span></p>

<strong><span>ABAC, PBAC, and RAdAC</span></strong><p><span>These models may involve a significant number of external systems that host attribute data. Once the elements required to access a resource are defined, the Digital Policy is created based on those requirements. The Access Permissions from the Privilege Management Life Cycle are associated with the various requirements for accessing a specific resource defined in the Digital Policy. This policy is implemented via a centrally managed authorization engine. During the Policy Execution part of the Framework, this engine compares the data received during an access attempt, the data required by the resource, and the Access Permission information within the policy. A successful grant access decision is made if all requirements are met and the appropriate permissions are applied.</span></p>

</div>

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Evaluate the policy or policies.** During this phase you’ll evaluate the policies designed and developed on test assets or resources. The use cases developed during the creation phase are used to independently test how well the requirements are being met. The results of these tests can then be used to improve the policy to validate that defined metrics and goals are being met.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Implement and enforce new policies.** During this process, you’ll carry out the new or revised policy on a production physical or logical asset or resource.  Once implemented, the policy can be tested to verify compliance with requirements.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Review and revise policies.** During this process, you’ll measure the effectiveness of the policy implemented and determine if the access control policy should be revised or retired. This phase includes the periodic review and testing of an access control policy to confirm that it continues to satisfy requirements and meet metrics goals. This process may also help identify policies that are either no longer necessary or that should be revised, allowing an agency to take appropriate action.


## <span style="color: #a61406"><a name="step10"></a>**Step 10: Manage the System Development Life Cycle**</span>

The System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a systematic, repeatable process that agencies can follow to develop new systems that will help them achieve their access control goals. It will help you manage existing and developing tools and technologies. While there are many variations of the SDLC, the simplest and most commonly used model is the waterfall model that includes five phases: Planning, Requirements and Design, Build, Implement, and Operate and Maintain. 

Most agencies have some variation of the SLDC in place to manage and maintain elements of their enterprise architecture. The same SDLC can be used to develop the tools and technology that are used as enablers within the Access Management Framework.

### Checklist 

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Prepare all elements required to begin the development of a system.** During this step, you’ll need to prepare a communications plan, cost/benefit analysis of access control tools procurement and development, business plan, implementation plan/schedule, and a risk management plan. The goal of this phase is to develop a plan for the specific access control tools and technologies that need to be developed for the access control solution.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Document the requirements and design of the access control solution.** During this step, you’ll need to define how the solution should operate in the existing infrastructure. This phase can include gathering and validating requirements, securing funding, acquiring resources, and documenting the access control tool/technology design and solution architecture. Successful completion of the Requirements and Design phase can prevent unnecessary rework as the tool/technology is built and implemented.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Build the technical solution, configure, and test the system.** During this phase, you’ll configure servers/hardware, install software, implement security controls, and test the build. You’ll need to focus on building the access control tool/technology based on the outputs of previous phases within the SDLC. You’ll also need to test the solution to make sure the tool/technology meets defined requirements and performs as intended.

<div style="background-color: #edf1f3;color: black;margin: 10px;padding: 10px">

<h3><span>What are examples of tools and technologies that my agency might employ?</span></h3>
<p><span>Tools and technologies can range from a centrally managed enterprise solution that handles extensive policy compliance and enforcement to a locally developed tool that helps a resource owner manage the ACL for their resource.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Processes for provisioning access to a resource</span></li>
<li><span>Forms requesting that access to a resource be provisioned for a user</span></li>
<li><span>Locally controlled management tools</span></li>
<li><span>Native resource access controls</span></li>
<li><span>Identity and Access Management (IAM) suites</span></li>
<li><span>Policy authorization engines</span></li>
</ul>

</div>

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Implement the access control solution.** During this phase, you’ll migrate the solution from a development/test environment to an agency’s production infrastructure. Some activities include deploying the tool/technology to the production environment, conducting user acceptance testing and user training, and performing awareness and outreach activities so that all stakeholders understand how the new access control methods work and why they’re important.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Perform ongoing management and system maintenance activities.** Once you’ve implemented the access control solution, you must maintain the system’s operational status and make appropriate updates to uphold the security integrity and make sure the system operates correctly. Some activities in this phase include monitoring security controls, installing upgrades and patches, refreshing technology, and performing ongoing user training.
